The escalating demand for sustainable energy, particularly solar power, as a key solution to climate change is hindered by the substantial initial investment required for solar power plants. The conventional method of predicting solar energy output relies on expensive solar irradiance measurements, posing barriers to accessibility and affordability, especially for smaller-scale applications. SunSmartML was designed as a transformative solution by introducing a machine learning model that accurately predicts solar power generation based on real time weather conditions and geographic location. This alternative approach eliminates the need for costly measurements, making solar energy predictions more feasible and widespread. SunSmartML predicts solar energy using a broad dataset that consists of 17 features that collectively influence the energy output of a solar panel. The incorporation of machine learning enables precise predictions applicable not only to large-scale solar power plants but also at the individual level, empowering informed decision-making for solar panel installations at both commercial and individual levels. The study utilizes three approaches to deliver predictions for solar energy given an input consisting of 1) Random Forest Regressor that is used to train a model based on prediction variables, 2) Web-app that gathers user information such as geographic data necessary for gathering weather data, and 3) Real-time weather api that enhances the accuracy of the model before output. This research aligns with global efforts to make renewable energy inclusive along with higher resilience and reliability in solar energy generation along with many economic advantages, contributing significantly to sustainable development goals, reducing carbon footprints, and fostering a more environmentally conscious future.
